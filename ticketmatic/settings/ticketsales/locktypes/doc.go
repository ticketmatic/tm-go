// When configuring an event, it is possible to reserve some tickets or make them
// unavailable.
//
// Lock types define the ways how these tickets can be blocked.
//
// Some examples:
//
// * Seats unavailable due to technical reasons (e.g. a PA installation)
//
// * Reserved seats for people with limited mobility
//
// * An extra contingent of tickets that might be added later, but shouldn't be
// sold right away
//
// For more info, check setting up events
// (https://www.ticketmatic.com/docs/events/events).
